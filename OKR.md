# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2018 Q3

**Ship Peer & Content Routing**
- Delegated Peer Routing is completed 
- Delegated Content Routing is completed  
- DHT interops with go-libp2p

**libp2p debugging is not painful**
- Error handling is done correctly and error codes are part of the API
- libp2p and libp2p-switch become full state machines
- libp2p has a network visualization tool 

**libp2p is seen as the goto p2p networking stack**
- js-libp2p releases get proper fanfare
- kick off the js.libp2p.io Welcome page
- Onboard 3 new full time contributors

Once these OKRs are finished, you will be able to find them on the [2018 Q3 libp2p OKRs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HTXfgR5FyPTFhsTkFPRThkeMvHvCgJOaAs7BSl_vQ_0/edit#gid=1241853194)

## Previous Quarters

For the quarters before 2018 Q3, js-libp2p shared their KRs with the [IPFS OKRs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/OKR.md).
